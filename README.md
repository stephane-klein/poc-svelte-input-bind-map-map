In this "playground", I'm trying to edit the data of a map of map (see [`src/routes/+page.svelte`](./src/routes/+page.svelte)).

I'm aware of the ["Bind to a Map() Object not possible #5721"](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/5721) issue, but while I'm waiting for it to be completed, and also for my personal culture, I'd like to find out how to implement it.

Context in french: https://github.com/stephane-klein/backlog/issues/295

```sh
$ asdf install
$ pnpm install
$ pnpm run dev
```
